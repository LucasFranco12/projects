                    <h4>Website (HTML, CSS)</h4>
                    <p>Created a personal website showcasing my skills, projects, and hobbies using HTML and CSS. Can be seen here: <a href="https://LucasFranco12.github.io">LucasFranco12.github.io</a></p>

                  <li>
                    <h4>Artificial Intelligence (Python, Q-Learning)</h4>
                    <p>Developed a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning to play blackjack, achieving a 47% win rate against the dealer after training on 1 billion episodes. Implemented state representation encoding player's hand value, dealer's visible card, and true count (card counting technique) to capture the game's relevant information. Employed Q-table and NumPy to store and update action values for each state, enabling the agent to learn an optimal policy through iterative updates based on rewards and future expected returns.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Socket Programming (C++, Pthreads)</h4>
                    <p>Developed immersive Battleship game using C++ and socket programming to support seamless multiplayer interactions. Supports up to 30 players. Utilized the Pthread library for efficient multi-threaded communication and synchronization between clients and server, ensuring smooth multiplayer coordination. Utilized data structures and algorithms for efficient game state management and board representation.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Web Scraping (Python, Selenium)</h4>
                    <p>Designed and implemented an Amazon Web Scraper using Selenium in python to perform automated extraction and analysis of product reviews. Developed a system to identify potential biased reviewers by analyzing their profile information, such as the number of upvotes received. Implemented web automation techniques, including navigation, data extraction, and interaction with web elements using Selenium.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Solar Energy Impact Analysis (HTML, PostgreSQL)</h4>
                    <p>Led the design and development of a web application using HTML, to analyze the impact of solar energy adoption on C02 reduction in New Jersey. Developed the backend using PostgreSQL to store and manage data on solar panel installations and CO2 emissions in municipalities from 2015 to 2020. Organized team members to effectively contribute by delegating tasks based on their strengths.</p>
